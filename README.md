# PIL-image-texture-alpha-loader
This repository is made using PIL

# Instructions: 
Put in an image file into the "Input1" folder inside the "Input files here" folder. 

This file will be the background for the alpha channel to go onto.

Put in another image file of the same dimentions into "Input2" in the same folder.

Run main.py

It will create 2 files. A grayscale and a final product file. This will all be found in the output folder.

IMPORTANT: Replace placeholders in the "Input files here" folder with the images you want to use
